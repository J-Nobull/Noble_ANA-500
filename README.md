# Mental Health Treatment Analysis Across Countries

## 📂 Data Source
The project uses the "Mental Health in Tech Survey" dataset from Kaggle.

## 🧰 Skills and Tools Applied
- Data Science Workflow:
  - Data inspection, cleaning, organization, transformation, and analysis using Python.
- Programming Tools:
  - Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation and exploration.
- Data Visualization
  - Created plots and charts using Plotly and Matplotlib to uncover insights.
- Machine Learning & Modeling (ML algorithms using Scikit-learn):
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine           

## 📖 Project Overview

This project explores how workplace mental health treatment patterns differ between the United States and other countries.  
The analysis uses machine learning models to identify key features influencing the likelihood of seeking treatment, based on factors such as benefits, wellness programs, coworker support, leave policies, and awareness of health consequences.

## 🎯 Objective

- Build predictive models to distinguish between individuals who seek mental health treatment and those who do not.
- Compare mental health patterns between the United States and Other Countries.
- Identify actionable features that the United States could emphasize to improve mental health outcomes.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Data Balancing Techniques (Hybrid Undersampling and Oversampling)

## 📈 Key Steps
1. Data cleaning and feature engineering.
2. Balancing class distribution using hybrid sampling (600 samples per class).
3. Training and evaluating three models:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. Extracting and comparing feature importance between the USA and Other Countries.

## 🧠 Key Findings

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** provided the clearest separation of features between countries.
- Other Countries emphasize **proactive mental health measures**:
  - Stronger **wellness programs**.
  - **Flexible leave policies**.
  - Greater **coworker support**.
- In contrast, the United States tends to act **after work interference becomes severe**, emphasizing **care options** and **benefits** later in the stress cycle.
- Potential opportunities exist for the U.S. to **improve early prevention** efforts through organizational wellness strategies.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Open and run the `Noble_ANA650.ipynb` notebook.
4. Follow through each section: Set Environment → Load data → Clean data → Modeling → Evaluation → Feature Interpretation.
